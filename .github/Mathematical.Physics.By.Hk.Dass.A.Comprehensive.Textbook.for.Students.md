# Mathematical Physics By Hk Dass: A Comprehensive Textbook for Students
 
Mathematical physics is a branch of physics that applies mathematical concepts and methods to solve physical problems. It is an essential tool for understanding the fundamental laws of nature and exploring various phenomena in physics. Mathematical physics also provides a bridge between pure mathematics and applied sciences.

One of the popular textbooks for mathematical physics is *Mathematical Physics* by Hk Dass and Rama Verma. This book has been written to provide the readers a clear understanding of the mathematical concepts which are an important part of modern physics. The textbook contains 49 chapters on all major topics in an exhaustive endeavour to cover syllabuses of all major universities. Some of the important topics covered in these chapters are Vectors, Integration, Beta and Gamma functions, Differential Equations, Complex Numbers, Matrix and Determinants, and the Laplace transforms[^1^].
 
The book also contains numerous solved examples, exercises, and objective questions to help the students practice and test their knowledge. The book is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students of physics, engineering, and mathematics. The book is also useful for competitive examinations like NET, GATE, JEST, etc.
 
The latest edition of the book is available in both print and digital formats. The print version can be purchased from S. Chand Publishing or other online platforms. The digital version can be accessed as an ebook from Google Books or other websites[^1^]. However, some students may not be able to afford or access the book due to various reasons. For such students, there are some online sources that offer free pdf downloads of the book or some of its chapters.
 
One such source is pdfphy.blogspot.com, which provides free pdf downloads of various books and notes for physics students. The website claims to have a high quality pdf file of *Mathematical Physics* by Hk Dass with solutions of all chapters and exercises[^2^]. However, the authenticity and legality of this source cannot be verified, and the users are advised to use it at their own risk.
 
Another source is deepcarepm.com, which provides a pdf file of *Mathematical Physics* by Hk Dass with 558 pages. The website does not provide any details about the edition or the content of the file, but it seems to be related to peroxynitrite accumulation in chronic renal failure patients treated with PD-L1[^3^]. This source seems to be irrelevant and unreliable for the purpose of studying mathematical physics.
 
Therefore, it is recommended that students who want to study mathematical physics by Hk Dass should try to obtain the original book from authorized sources or use alternative books that are freely available online. Some examples of such books are *Mathematical Methods for Physicists* by Arfken et al., *Mathematical Methods in Physics* by Mathews and Walker, and *A Course in Mathematical Physics* by Thirring.
